## Product List

This project has been created by a student at Project Shift, a software engineering fellowship located in Downtown Durham.  The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

## To Boot Up

Have Two Terminal Windows Running Concurrently.

In the first, navigate to the product-list directory and run "nodemon server/server.js"

In the second, navigate to the client directory and run "npm start"

At first, there may be a failure to compile error. If that is the case, give it a couple of seconds to allow the server to start up. Once you're in the green (see also, receive the prompt stating 'starting node server.js') you should be good to go.
